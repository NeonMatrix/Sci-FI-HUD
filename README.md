## Sci-Fi-HUD
Processing Sci Fi HUD for OOP

I made this sci fi HUD, taking inspiration from Star Trek Discovrty, with all the blue and transparcy feel of the holograms

# **Instructions:**
To use the laser, just click on the "Laser" button and use your mouse to aim, 
click the left mouse button to shoot, hold the mouse botton for a continious laser beam.
To warp, you first click on the star map button, which is the grid aboive the warp button.
Click on the star you want, and when the warp button turns green, click the warp button 
and you will warp to that star.
In the star map, if you click one star then anther you will get to see the distance between the stars
measured in parsecs.

I made this HUD with Processing, coded in Java using sereval Processing in-built libraries. I am really happy with the whole look and feel of the HUD. I am most proud uf the warp drive, the animtion and how you can wrap to a star you selected of the star map.
